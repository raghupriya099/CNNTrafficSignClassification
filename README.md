# CNN-Based Traffic Sign Classification

A deep learning project for classifying traffic signs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The implementation is provided in the notebook `TafficSignClassification.ipynb`.

---

## 1. Introduction  
This project presents a CNN model capable of recognizing various traffic signs from image data. It is designed as a part of efforts toward computer vision solutions for autonomous systems.

## 2. Problem Statement  
Reliable traffic sign recognition is essential for driver-assistance systems. This model aims to classify traffic sign images accurately and efficiently.

## 3. Dataset  
The project relies on the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** dataset—a standard benchmark for multi-class traffic sign classification. It contains over **50,000 images** spanning **43 classes**:
- **Training images**: ~39,209  
- **Test images**: ~12,630 :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Data Preprocessing  
- Load images using `tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory` or similar APIs.  
- Normalize pixel values to [0, 1].  
- Optionally apply data augmentation (e.g., flips, rotations) to enhance generalization.

### 4.2 Model Architecture  
- Built using Keras’s `Sequential` API.  
- Layers include `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `Flatten`, `Dropout`, and `Dense`.  
- Designed to output class probabilities via a `softmax` activation.

### 4.3 Compilation  
- **Loss**: `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` (suitable for integer labels)  
- **Optimizer**: Adam (adaptive learning)  
- **Metric**: Accuracy  

### 4.4 Training  
- Train with `model.fit()` on training/validation sets.  
- Monitor performance and apply early stopping if needed.

### 4.5 Evaluation & Inference  
- Evaluate performance via `model.evaluate()` on the test set.  
- Generate predictions using `model.predict()` and convert probabilities to class indices with `np.argmax()`.

### 4.6 Visualization  
- Display sample images annotated with true vs. predicted labels for qualitative inspection.  
- (Optional) Include learning curves and confusion matrices in the full report.

## 6. Discussion  
Expand upon aspects like:
- Model generalization and overfitting indicators  
- Misclassification trends  
- Class-wise performance (e.g., via confusion matrix)

## 7. Comparison with Related Work  
Similar efforts using GTSRB typically achieve **95–99% accuracy**, particularly when using advanced architectures or extensive augmentation :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  
Variants such as LeNet, VGG, or GoogLeNet have been applied successfully in other projects :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

## 8. Conclusion  
This notebook demonstrates an effective CNN pipeline for traffic sign classification—from data loading and model training to evaluation and prediction.

## 9. Future Work  
Potential next steps:
- Experiment with deeper architectures (e.g., ResNet variants)  
- Incorporate additional datasets (e.g., Mapillary, GLARE) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Deploy the model on embedded systems or real-time applications
